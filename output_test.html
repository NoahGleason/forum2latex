<p>Sooo, there's never a day where I don't see any posts relating to "well I wish I lived in Equestria" or "well I wish I was a pony" so here you guys go, you equestrian race dreamers, here's the next best thing!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/135UFEsaCEgWuQ3w0-KMb_f8BEFac26bPrJx2HCpeTrA/edit#heading=h.w6c82t8k31ic" rel="external nofollow">https://docs.google.com/document/d/135UFEsaCEgWuQ3w0-KMb_f8BEFac26bPrJx2HCpeTrA/edit#heading=h.w6c82t8k31ic</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Yeah I tried the Pinkie Pie one last night, and it worked fairly well except for whatever reason I broke out if it midway and for the next hour or two I noticed myself acting more crazy and social than usual. If you're gonna try 'em, I'd&#160;recommend&#160;using the ind+BGM downloads just because that will help out with the hypnotic trance but that's up to you.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>So, if you're gonna come in here and be all like "I don't believe in hypnosis because yadda yadda yadda" be quiet because hypnosis is real aaaand is actually 100% safe. I studied hypnosis a year or two ago, and even though I kind of can hypnotize somebody, these people do it waaay better than I can at the moment (I always screw up in the trance part and somehow make them laugh)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Anyhoo, have fun with these things. The people who made these did a nice job.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>-edit-</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="color:rgb(40,40,40);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">In response to all the people with issues, I don't think that it's because you aren't susceptible to hypnosis because in reality everyone is, rather I'd say that there's a number of factors involved. Probably the biggest factor is that there's just different ways of getting people into that specific trance and that this method might not work the first time for everyone. I've talked with hypnotists before and they all say that everyone is susceptible to hypnosis, regardless of disability or age (although getting a little kid to concentrate on this will be so damned hard holy crap)</p>
<p style="color:rgb(40,40,40);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</p>
<p style="color:rgb(40,40,40);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">What I would suggest for this is to keep on trying. Before you do try again, use your own method of relaxation because I know we all have it. If this means laying down in the dark listening to some meditation music than do it. You're also going to need to concentrate not on becoming a pony, rather concentrating on the voice.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(40,40,40);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</p>
<p style="color:rgb(40,40,40);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The main issue I'm seeing with those that it didn't work is that they were excited to try this, and I'm not trying to be mean here but I think that excitement about becoming the pony is causing issues. Once again, relax and just find your own method to clear your mind.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(40,40,40);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</p>
<p style="color:rgb(40,40,40);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">-edit #2-</p>
<p style="color:rgb(40,40,40);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</p>
<p>Alright, alright, alright, alright. The posts that are &#160;put throughout the thread kind of lead me to believe that the way these people do this isn't working for everyone (and I will admit, it's a little bit different than what I usually hear). Before maybe next week starts I will have some alternate files with my own induction techniques that I'm hoping will be of greater assistance.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This will be the first time in about a year I've tried to induce somebody into a trance, so it might take a bit. I'll update the first post once I get something done.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>edit #3</p>
<p>lol after many months I still haven't delivered</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>edit #4</p>
<p>FINLAND</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>edit#5<br>I swear to god next person who brings up tulpae in this thread... uuughh... Lemme just say it right now to make it clear: TULPAE AND HYPNOSIS ARE TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THINGS! Hypnosis is just getting into a state where you're more open to suggestion where as tulpae are actually altering your mind in an attempt to have a separate personality in there that you can see and touch. Also while we're at it since some people who are ZOMG TULPAE have contacted me and said that hypnosis is crap: there's much more actual evidence for hypnosis than there are for tulpae.<br><br>Also the downloads for the files are currently gone for a little. Derp.</p>

<p>You're probably thinking too hard. Just take a deep breath, and relax. Listen to some relaxing music for a few minutes and try again. To be hypnotized, you have to essentially be in a trance which is generally achieved through relaxation</p>

<p>It's not painful. It's relaxing, I tried it and it actually worked for a few minutes or so but I snapped myself out of it somehow. I'm not sure how. I tried the Fluttershy one.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It washed over a numbness over me, and I lost feeling in my fingers. I eventually felt the urge to be kind to be people for some reason. It was really weird and surreal. I could feel my heart beating too, rapidly, and also, the coolest thing was that it felt good, actually.</p>

<p>Huh. xD I got around 3/4 of the way through the Twilight one. I can't believe I even tried it, as I'm sure it can be dangerous. Demons can enter you this way, I'm sure. It didn't really affect me, though... I did get tired, and I tried to imagine all of the "changes" he was talking about, but nothing really happened. I'm going to stay away form things like this from now on, for as some have said, it gets you intrigued, and maybe even addicted, and bad things could happen.&#160; <img src="https://buffy.mlpforums.com/emoticons/mlp_PR6Zd18.png" alt=":ph34r:"></p>

<p>I'm a Christian, BTW, so this is more of a moral issue for me rather than that I don't want to do it. Being relaxed and "emptying your mind" is the perfect opportunity for demons to sneak in, so Imma stay away from it. <img src="https://buffy.mlpforums.com/emoticons/mlp_unsure.png" alt=":unsure:"></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Hypnotic effects wear off the moment you want them to wear off. I've dabbled in hypnosis for a while and the only thing I've really succeded in doing is curing my panic attacks (which that on its own has made it worth while). The way I define hypnosis is anything that takes advantage of brain quirks. For example, have you ever gotten up to go to a differant room and when you get to that room you suddenly forget why you went there? Its a funky little brain quirk, and believe it or not, its times like that when you are easily subjected to hypnotic suggestion.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Hypnosis is harmless, it can't make you do anything you're strongly obliged not to do.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This sounds fun, Ima try it later.</p>

<p>Huh. xD I got around 3/4 of the way through the Twilight one. I can't believe I even tried it, as I'm sure it can be dangerous. Demons can enter you this way, I'm sure. It didn't really affect me, though... I did get tired, and I tried to imagine all of the "changes" he was talking about, but nothing really happened. I'm going to stay away form things like this from now on, for as some have said, it gets you intrigued, and maybe even addicted, and bad things could happen.&#160; <img src="https://buffy.mlpforums.com/emoticons/mlp_PR6Zd18.png" alt=":ph34r:"></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I'm a Christian, BTW, so this is more of a moral issue for me rather than that I don't want to do it. Being relaxed and "emptying your mind" is the perfect opportunity for demons to sneak in, so Imma stay away from it. <img src="https://buffy.mlpforums.com/emoticons/mlp_unsure.png" alt=":unsure:"></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I'm fairly sure that relaxing isn't something Christians believe can cause demons to enter you, after all, I was one for half my life. Bad things can't and won't happen simply because you try to enjoy yourself.</p>

<p>It wears off when you want it to, as in, when you think about it wearing off, it does. I generally think because it takes advantage of natural brain processes like suggestion and placebo.</p>

<p>The effect will wear off when you want it to wear off.Have you ever been to a county fair? Next time you're there go check out a hypnotist show and they will show you just how silly and harmless it really is.

			<p>This definitely works. I chose Twilight since I had homework to do. My focus wasn't broken ONCE. I'm not entirely sure how its going to come out. But this truly works. The limbs changing is very odd, but yet relaxing. Almost like a tingling, calming feel. I might try Fluttershy, too.</p>

<p>To clear things up for people, Hypnosis is 100% safe. It just puts your brain in a hyper-suggestive state (starting to get close to a dream), but you aren't a zombie slave or anything. You can break out of it at any time. You are always in control. Trust me, I've studied the subject a lot and I know the basics.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Note that everyone is different and it might take some people longer, and vice versa. No-one is insusceptible to Hypnosis, but for some people it may take a few tries. Note that you have to go in without any resistance and willingness to follow orders as well, which may be a problem for some people. Also, extroverted people tend to have an easier time with Hypnosis, while introverted people aren't as likely.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>So feel free to try this, nothing in it can hurt you, except the possibility of a nasty computer virus. I might try it later, need to boost my overall morale and personality a little.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>P.S If you do it regularly, the results will get better and better.</p>

<p>What this man said, gentlemen. I have never once heard of a case where hypnosis has had a negative effect on people and there will never be a case where hypnosis has a negative effect on&#160;people. In fact this is so good I'm gonna slap it up on the first post.</p>

<p>The more often you listen, the easier it gets. You relax faster, go deeper into trance, and become more suggestive.</p>

<p>Well yeah, just relaxing won't do anything, but clearing your mind and the like (things you often hear about in modern movies that contain a special "force" -- like Star Wars) can open the gate for demons.

<p>You just feel like it, honestly. It makes you feel as if you were actually the pony the hypnotist is suggesting. You can feel it in mind and body. Rather weird and strangely nice at the same time.</p>

			<p>I just tried the Twilight one and wow.... That was probably the most amazing experience of my life. I've wanted to try being hypnotised for a very long time, but I wasn't brave enough to volunteer at any of the shows I've been too (especially the adult ones). I could definitely feel the hooves form and I could vaguely feel the horn when it was finally formed, but I didn't get the mane or tail. I still feel all tingly and it's really nice. I don't think I've ever been so relaxed before... I will definitely be doing this again.</p>

<p>Second try. Still nothing, but I felt more relaxed than last. I think this is going as it should. I'll post again with the results next time I try.</p>

<p>Also, a question: Do you actually see the "changes" or do you just feel them?</p>

<p>It helps to have your eyes closed. That way you imaginine it happening and feel it. I think you'd either have to be on drugs or have an impossibly large imagination to actually see it happening.</p>

<p>I have at least gotten some success with it. First I did Twilight and I felt my hooves and vaguely felt a horn every so often during its formation. It wasn't perfect by any means, but it was definitely partly there. I can't really describe what was going on in my head it was.... It was really nice. I am currently more relaxed and life feels so much nicer than anytime in my memory. It is super nice. With Pinkie I felt the hooves forming and I vaguely got a sense of happiness. For neither of them did I feel the mane, tail, or ears but perhaps with practice I'll feel them.</p>
<p>Next time I'll do either Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash, I'm not quite sure which yet.</p>


			
		</div>

		<div data-role="commentContent" class="ipsType_normal ipsType_richText ipsContained" data-controller="core.front.core.lightboxedImages">
			
<p>I tried Twilight, but I don't think it worked. Then again, it probably wasn't a good idea to judge this thing because I picked my favorite pony. A pony who is my favorite because she and I share many similar traits such as introversion, a love of reading and a passion for learning, so even if it did work, I'm not sure if I'm capable of telling the difference.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Maybe I should have picked a pony I'm the least like. Pinkie Pie, Rarity and Rainbow Dash are probably the least like me. Although whether or not I'm like Pinkie Pie depends on how much caffeine I've consumed. I'll try again with another pony.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Besides, whether or not it will work for me doesn't really matter. These are nice to listen to either way.</p>

<p>Trust me, I've hypnotized myself before, and it's a very nice experience. Very relaxing, you can snap out whenever you want, and if you do it repeatedly, it has lasting effects.</p>

<p>Also, @pokesonicfan11, do whatever is more comfortable for you, but I would recommend sitting down, as all your muscles need to be nice and relaaaaaaaaxed.</p>

			<p>So I just did Twilight again. This time I felt EVERYTHING;the hooves, the "plot", the leg-widening, the horn, nuzzle, ears, mane and everything. This time I put a black blanket over my eyes which helped me relax alot. When I did Fluttershy I felt the wings, almost a hot, but calming sensation from my shoulder blades. Its not harmful, and it won't harm you in any way whatsoever. I suggest to everypony to lay down in your bed, head on the pillow, and a blanket covering your eyes. It felt more amazing than the last time, so go for it! (Amazing, my writing and descriptive skills have already improved from it! ^^)</p>

			<p>Okay, so I did Rainbow Dash just now, and it was just my first time, so not much happened. Here are the highlights. Firstly, I had a left front hoof. I was astonishingly relaxed and it felt numb and I felt extremely relaxed. I could feel my hoof and I am definitely much more confident right now as I write this. It was like someone was massaging my hand, going in a soft, circular motion, definitely one of the best things I ever felt. Then came the counting up, when one was supposed to wake up. Well, I admit I got pretty tired as the hypnosis was happening, and as she counted up, I actually got more and more awake. This definitely has my approval and I will use it again sometime, probably for RD, Twilight or Fluttershy.</p>

<p>Lying down, definitely. Helps your muscles relax easier.</p>

<p>Well I tried doing the Rarity one</p>
<p>But I didn't make it through the whole thing</p>
<p>It was a 22 minute audio track</p>
<p>And judging by the comments I'd say that it would be trustworthy</p>
<p>All you require is a good quality pair of headphones with noise isolation on them</p>
<p>In a quiet place and you're set to go, apparently so</p>

<p>So what...do we just listen to it? Or is there some weird practice where I need an eagle claw, a lion paw, and a snake tail? I've never done hypnosis...</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>*Edit* Tried RD....voice at beginning freaked me out....thought someone was going to jump out of my computer...</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>*Edit Edit* So I tried, but think I messed up. Am I suppose to know what's going on during the hypnosis? I was able to hear everything, but my body went relaxed and I didn't feel like doing anything. But I never felt like a pony. Did I do something wrong? Or am I being trolled?</p>

<p>Guess it all comes down to the individual. I tried the pinkie pie one and I felt quite relaxed and didn't really take anything seriously. Didn't really have a craving for sweets though (Picks up M&amp;M's). Anywho, I enjoyed it so it wasn't bad. It was a little freaky trying it at first as I wasn't used to being so relaxed. I stopped a few minutes in and was kind of shaking from it and reeling what the hell just happened. A few minutes later I tried it again after getting a better understanding and It turned out alright. I dunno i'm rambling I guess.&#160;</p>

<p>I tried the Twiley one, and it partially worked. I entered a state of total relaxation and--no joke--I legit felt my fingers and toes fusing to become hooves. It felt really weird and really awesome.</p>
<p>Still, I couldn't feel my unicorn horn, nor fully believe everything the voice said. Ah well; it still made me feel really good.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Maybe I should try the Pinkie Pie one! :3</p>

<p>I'm the same way as you are. stubborn and bull headed. I've managed meditation.</p>
<p>The trick with&#160;meditation&#160;is when you first start, try a mantra or something you can concentrate on. Alot of people just try clearing their minds, and at which point your mind becomes like a cat getting dipped in water. Bringing up old shit and running things through your head that make no sense. Even with something to concentrate on your mind stars behaving in odd ways. The trick is to keep trying at it.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure hypnosis works on me because I'm very analytical. I'll probably end up just thinking about the ways their trying to get you to go under.</p>

<p>I did pinkie pie. I found it very Strange It was very similar to a state of Meditation. I freaked a bit when it said my voice&#160;changed&#160;cause I started thinking in pinkies&#160;voice.</p>
<p>I didn't even think I went under really. I was thinking the entire time theres no way this shit will work. But Now whenver I say Pinkie Pies trigger phrase like the recording said. &#160;Feel like going out and doing fun shit even more so than I normally do.</p>
<p>I dont think it worked&#160;entirely. But that could be because I had a bit of a rude awakening and ruined it a bit.(As blood runs black started blaring in my earbuds as I was coming out of it. <img src="https://buffy.mlpforums.com/emoticons/mlp_happy.png" alt="^_^">&#160;)</p>
<p>My fingertips were rather numb when I came out of it. I was a little freaked out and decided to grab my knife and see just how numb they were.</p>
<p>Now i have a nice cut on my left index finger. <img src="https://buffy.mlpforums.com/emoticons/mlp_blink.png" alt=":blink:"></p>

			<p>Ok, little advice warning: you may not want to do the Pet Pegasus one. It; like the trance was supposed to, make you feel like an obedient, somewhat mentally dull, pet pegasus. However, it was still very relaxing and the intro is different than most of the Hypnosis Files. I might have to do Twilight after this though, because I am not sure how it may affect my homework ...</p>

			<p>Part of it is the setting itself; as a number of ponies have mentioned, you have to be very relaxed, and maybe in a fairly dark and relaxing setting. &#160;Another part is the individual; some are more susceptible to hypnotism than others. &#160;I've tried a couple of hypnotism vids in the past myself (not MLP related) and, while they sort of worked, sometimes I was in the wrong place, and other times I just couldn't get relaxed enough. &#160;I also had the feeling that I'd have to listen to said vids on a regular basis for the full effect, so I eventually just kinda gave up on it. &#160;Don't think I'll try these vids, even though I'm sure they're perfectly safe and sound very cool, mostly because there's no good place in my college dorm to listen to it. &#160;My bed's simply not comfortable enough, and being a bunk, I'd constantly be distracted by the thought of and worrying about falling out!&#160; <img src="https://buffy.mlpforums.com/emoticons/mlp_laugh.png" alt=":lol:">&#160; &#160;Still, good luck to anypony who tries these out, they sound pretty cool!!!&#160; <img src="https://buffy.mlpforums.com/emoticons/mlp_8pfRZzv.png" alt=":D"></p>

			<p>Okay, that was the WEIRDEST thing ever. I can't even explain how that felt. I didn't manage to go through it completely, so I'm going to have to try again, but even at then, things were weird and it was awkward to use anything or move around. The thing that leaves me asking is what am I supposed to be doing while I try this? When I tried it, I was laying on my back, and that actually seemed to stop things from happening, like feeling wings or a tail. None the less, that was completely&#160;bizarre.</p>

<p>Either one will work. Probably day after day but it mostly depends on who is doing it. I didn't do one with wings so I couldn't tell you about that part.</p>

<p>Interesting.&#160; I stumbled upon this thread yesterday and I finally got around to doing it today.&#160;&#160; I got about 1/2 through the Twilight one before getting interuptted.&#160; I felt relaxed, but that's about it.&#160; Then, I decided to give Fluttershy a shot.&#160; I was just going through these for curiosities sake.&#160; I must say, it was an odd feeling.&#160; I got about 1/2 way through Fluttershy too though.&#160; However, the effects were much more immediate.&#160; Although I didn't feel the hooves and whatnot, I did begin to feel them form.&#160; It doesn't really work in the way the voice describes it.&#160; It's almost like your limbs are slowly being replaced by them rather than your limbs forming into them.&#160; I'll probably commit fully when I go to bed.&#160; Even though I'm home alone ATM, phone calls keep interuptting.&#160; Hopefully it will work fully tonight.</p>
<p>I'll post tomorrow with the results.</p>

<p>My mind is a perpetual loop of "I AM.....THE LAW!" but it didn't stop me. But in all seriousness, there is a track on the page that is meant to help you clear your head.

			<p>Well I tried it, it kinda worked, I felt really relaxed and I felt like a pony, but not like RD (who I was trying to be). It was really weird, sort of like my own personality was there but I was still a pony. And afterwards for a few minutes may entire body felt heavy and tingly.</p>

<p>In response to all the people with issues, I don't think that it's because you aren't susceptible to hypnosis because in reality everyone is, rather I'd say that there's a number of factors involved. Probably the biggest factor is that there's just different ways of getting people into that specific trance and that this method might not work the first time for everyone. I've talked with hypnotists before and they all say that everyone is susceptible to hypnosis, regardless of disability or age (although getting a little kid to concentrate on this will be so damned hard holy crap)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>What I would suggest for this is to keep on trying. Before you do try again, use your own method of relaxation because I know we all have it. If this means laying down in the dark listening to some meditation music than do it. You're also going to need to concentrate not on becoming a pony, rather concentrating on the voice.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The main issue I'm seeing with those that it didn't work is that they were excited to try this, and I'm not trying to be mean here but I think that excitement about becoming the pony is causing issues. Once again, relax and just find your own method to clear your mind.</p>

<p>So, I ended up doing Rarity and Twilight. Both worked really well, enough for me to try again at a later time. You just have to zone out into this meditative state and relax and&#160;concentrate. It's really fun and there's no side effects so go ahead and have fun!</p>

<p>Report #3!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>3rd try for the Pinkie Pie file. I felt mostly the same as last time. Barely felt the transformation, as if it didn't happen. But I&#160;<em>did</em> feel more relaxed than last time. But you know what's strange? Afterwards, I tried walking like a pony, to see if it worked. Nothing. Then I spoke the phrase. All of a sudden, I felt dizzy. I started to feel the face and ear transformations, and my mouth opened. After feeling that, my body started to move onto all fours. Right after that, however, the feelings stopped. Will definitely try again soon.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Next time, I'll try to focus on the voice and the voice alone. Here's a good tip: If you have a music player, pop the file onto that instead of using your PC. I'm sure many of you do that, because it just makes sense.</p>
<br><br>4th try! I felt more relaxed. I felt the hooves a bit more, but really that's all of what's new. Am I doing something wrong? I lay on my back with my eyes closed, in my bedroom with the lights off. Why isn't this working?

<p>Well...I tried the fluttershy one...</p>
<p>I'm really sleepy right now, I don't think it worked. While I was listening I felt kinda...Different, But not Pony different.</p>
<p>I was wearing headphones and I was sitting down...Maybe I did something wrong...I will try again...At some point.</p>
<p>Also...Would it be a bad idea to try another pony ? Or should I just stick with Fluttershy...I have no idea what i'm doing.</p>

			<p>I listened to the pinkie pie with bgm loop for about an hour while lying in my bed, and I must say I have never once felt as relaxed before ever in my entire life, and I actually felt as if I was actually a mare. One question though is this just going to make you feel like a pony or is it eventually going to make me able to move around in my subconscious as a pony as if it were a lucid dream? (I have a feeling this is impossible.)</p>

<p>Well, here. Don't just sit back and observe as the voice tells you what to do, rather try and actually do what it says.&#160;Unfortunately&#160;you can't just sit back and watch the show, in fact hypnosis is really about you doing what you were suggested to do, so just let go of yourself and let the voice control you.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I'd try to maybe take a few long deep breaths before you start it, maybe stretch a little bit, and hey maybe some herbal tea or something right beforehand could help out as well.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You have to actually listen to the voice and nothing else, and make sure you relax as much as you possibly can. After that let your mind go blank, literally don't think of anything at all and keep listening to the voice, this should be around the time that it starts telling you who you're going to be hypnotized into thinking you are If you do that you should be able to feel it but it can take a few tries to get the relaxation part right (getting your mind to go blank is probably the hardest part, at least it is for me).</p>

<p>Close your eyes and focus. Take deep breaths continuously. This will sustain the relaxation and even amplify it so that way it will be easier to focus on the suggestions.&#160;</p>

<p>Well... that was AWESOME! I just tried Twilight for the first time and felt pretty much everything. Half way through I was giggling 'I has a horn' lol.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I've been interested in hypnotism for a while now and I know a little bit about it (ever since my psych prof in college told me there is actually something to it), so it was a little easier for me. All I can say is, you have to 'give in,' yes its a placebo, but guess what, the placebo effect actually has tangible results (learned that in psych class too). Give in... just let the voice take control, and you will begin to experience the things that he's suggesting.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And yes, this is 100% safe, you only give him control for as long as you want him to be in control. In fact about about 3/4s of the way through the video I was like 'lol, ok yeah you know what you're doing, I'm me again.' And I was me again. Simple as that. The only reason why I didn't zap back to being me again earlier than that is because I DIDN'T WANT TO. I WANTED to be Twilight Sparkle for a while and yeah I got pretty close. I felt the horn, I felt the hooves, almost felt the mane. And I knew what was happening too, I knew at any moment I could stop it if I wanted to, but I didn't, cause it was fun. <img src="https://buffy.mlpforums.com/emoticons/mlp_smile.png" alt=":)"></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>BTW, look up my post in the life advice forum on how to cure panic attacks if you suffer from panic attacks... that's hypnotism too. <img src="https://buffy.mlpforums.com/emoticons/mlp_smile.png" alt=":)"></p>

<p>Report #3!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>3rd try for the Pinkie Pie file. I felt mostly the same as last time. Barely felt the transformation, as if it didn't happen. But I&#160;<em>did</em> feel more relaxed than last time. But you know what's strange? Afterwards, I tried walking like a pony, to see if it worked. Nothing. Then I spoke the phrase. All of a sudden, I felt dizzy. I started to feel the face and ear transformations, and my mouth opened. After feeling that, my body started to move onto all fours. Right after that, however, the feelings stopped. Will definitely try again soon.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Next time, I'll try to focus on the voice and the voice alone. Here's a good tip: If you have a music player, pop the file onto that instead of using your PC. I'm sure many of you do that, because it just makes sense.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>4th try! I felt more relaxed. I felt the hooves a bit more, but really that's all of what's new. Am I doing something wrong? I lay on my back with my eyes closed, in my bedroom with the lights off. Why isn't this working?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Spoke what phrase? I'm still new and very curious to this and I want to know what it is.</p>
<p>Tried it once last night, it was really good, but then my mom popped in and asked if I wanted some juice. Here's my response: "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMCoMJVPgB8" rel="external nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMCoMJVPgB8</a>"</p>

<p>I Tried the loop version about 4 or 5 times last night, although It wasn't effective at all.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>With the non looped version however I do feel a very slight sense of hooves forming, but not much. Wings/tail/mane I have never been able to imagine, although sometimes I can feel a bump on my forehead as a horn starts to grow.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>There was one moment however when my entire body became all warm and fuzzy. It's only happened once sofar, but felt really good when it did happen.</p>

<p>The voice says that all of the effects will return when you speak a certain phrase. In the case of the Pinkie Pie one, it's "I'm a fun pony."</p>

<p>I tried it once. I thought I had Fluttershy, but I must have <em>accidentally</em> clicked on Pinkie Pie before-hand...anyhow, I was too tired to pay attention and dozed off and started thinking about dragons instead. I was hoping that maybe Dovah-Pie, but that silly train of thought didn't work.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>By the way, the next time I heard the Smile song, I was able... well, forced, really... to experience the thing in 1st person. But only because I happened to think about the whole thing while listening to the song.</p>

<p>Tried the Vinyl Scratch hypnosis last night while lying in bed. It was...wow. I felt my fingers fade away (my feet were somewhere in between, kinda like anthro-ish hooves...if that explains it). The horn didn't really form, but I remember being overcome by a strong sense of euphoria when the story of how you get your cutie mark is explained. I even remember tasting rum a little when the narrator explains how you took your first shot of Pony Morgan. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I started to fall asleep as the narrator explained ear and muzzle changes. I didn't feel them, but I did feel a sense of comfort and peace. Then I fell asleep, and I had euphoric dreams (I didn't remember them, but I had the lingering feeling when I woke up).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Definitely doing this again.</p>

			<p>Ok so I tried this last night. I gave the Twilight one a try and even though I wasn't in a very comfy position, it actually kinda worked on me. I went numb and got all tingly and thought I started feeling the hooves but that's about it before it failed on me. I did feel more relaxed than i've every been in the process. I'll have to try it again later on today and see if I can get the Twilight one to work again. I have alot on my mind so i'm kinda surprised that I even got it to work in the first place. XD</p>

<p>I tried three times.&#160; I need some tips on how to do it perfectly.</p>
<p>So far, when laying down, I felt the transformation thing.&#160; But after I got up...it didn't work (unless you count knees moving on their own to walk on all fours xD)&#160; And I didn't <em>feel </em>like Fluttershy or a pony at all.&#160; (keep trying right xD)&#160; Especially after I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And for those who want to know:</p>
<p>When it got to the legs, I felt them moving.&#160; When it got to the flank I felt my spine moving upwards.&#160; When it got to legs moving apart, my legs seemed to move apart.&#160; When it got to muzzle...my jaw moved forward-ish.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Huh, Interesting, I've done it with Rainbow and Fluttershy.</p>
<p>Think with both my legs have fully transformed as they should which is awesome.</p>
<p>However I didn't feel wings or tail on Rainbow but did with Fluttershy. Was weird o_O tail felt like something was forcing itself out my spine. Same slightly with the wings, however I felt tingles up my spine and round the shoulders.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I'm going to watch TV for a bit until I feel more sleepy then try the applejack one.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>EDIT: RAGE QUIT no Loop+BGM for AppleJack...this man voice doesn't seem as relaxing as the woman :L worth a shot tho</p>

			<p>Man, this sucks for the bronies out there with ADHD. Darn ADHD always bugging you and making it IMPOSSIBLE to focus, or sit still for that matter. Remind anypony of Pinkie Pie?

Kinda awesome, even if my try was a flop.  My sis got hypnotized and she couldn't stand up at all until she said the special phrase.

<p>Report #6. I didn't feel as much changes this time, but I felt more of a need to stand on all fours afterwards. It was probably because I was laying in a terrible position.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>EDIT: Now that I'm at a PC, I can write more. When I say the phrase, I feel pretty mush nothing. It seems that for a while after I'm done listening to the file I feel the need to walk on all fours after saying the phrase, but that's it. I'm the same guy. I can still use my fingers, and I still constantly feel the need to listen to Voltage (or whatever my favorite song is at the moment). On top of that, my patience was pretty thin from the events of earlier today. I managed to calm down, but I almost didn't have the patience to listen to the whole 17 minute file. At least I made it through the whole thing. I twitched a lot, but that was probably because of how I was laying.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Wow, I can type a lot when I'm on a PC.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You are going to feel nothing once you get up, it takes place entirely within your mind. It isn't a physical change, it is the mental imposition of a physical change. Nothing is real, it is all in your mind</p>

<p>I know, 99.99% of the time I prefer reality too... but I made an exception for ponies :/ what you are doing is allowing yourself to be lied too (much like when on drugs, like LSD) to produce a false sensation in the body, it is basic cognitive neuro-science&#160;</p>

<p>sure, wearing as little clothing as possible and spread out four poster on a bed, complete darkness with a cloth over your eyes, and use headphones. Speakers will not work as you need full immersion to keep yourself from being pulled out of the fantasy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The less clothing you have on than the less material you have pressing against your skin, which means the less outside distractions that can pull you from the trance. It isn't mandatory, but the setup I usually roll with is No shirt, no socks, and wearing only basketball shorts. So if you achieve the trance how should you take what? I don't get the question</p>

<p>Maybe I'll try again tomorrow, but I tried Twilight's and it made me feel incredibly relaxed. I'm not sure if it's the hypnosis or the relaxed state, but I was having some trouble with writing my fanfiction earlier, but I'm not having nearly as much trouble now. The words are flying off of my fingers in such a way that I can't describe other than that it feels amazing.</p>

<p>EDIT: ok just finished pretty interesting it didn't fully work however.  Towards the end my friend texted me which did interrupt me too much I don't think.  My fingers started to loose feeling at the beginning and my arms felt numb at the end.  My toes fingers arms and legs felt heavy and I couldn't move easily.  As I'm typing this my arms feel funny still.  Maybe I'll give it a try again later</p>

			<p>So I gave it my 2nd go last night. I decided to try Rainbow Dash. It took a bit of time before I started to feel the transformation but I got alot further than I did with Twilight. I felt the hooves, the body shape transformation, and I even felt the wings. It was the more invigorating thing i've ever felt. Even right now I can still somewhat feel the wings which is kinda creepy but it was awesome.&#160;Definitely&#160;doing this again tonight.</p>

<p>Alright, so I just got time to try this for the first time. &#160;As I expected, it didn't quite work, though to no fault of the track itself. &#160;It's my own mind just being the way it is.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I did Pinkie Pie (because why not?). &#160;I think I was doing well until the guide said, "let everything unimportant leave your mind." &#160;Of course, my mind immediately went to 'everything important' which happened to be my Theory of Computation homework. &#160;I was pretty much lost after that. &#160;As for the transformations, I could sort of feel the rear end one, but not much. &#160;I also noticed that for a few minutes afterwards, the backs of my hands felt slightly harder than usual, but that has long since gone away, and likely doesn't mean anything either. &#160;It also doesn't help that immediately after the end of the track my music library switched to

<p>In conclusion, I'm sure that this works, however my mind is not trained to it yet. &#160;I would like to try to train my self to do so because I would love the relaxation benefits. &#160;This will not be the last time I attempt this. &#160;I may even have time for one more tonight.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A question: I noticed that there's loop files and non-loop files. &#160;Should I be looping these and listening multiple times, or just once? &#160;Does that just depend on the person?</p>

<p>Attempted the Twilight Sparkle one and it made me soooo relaxed!</p>
<p>I only got a few little sensations such as a horn and my face changing, but hopefully if I keep trying it it will work more and more! ^^</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Is there anything against trying different ones in the same day or something? Like, would switching to say, Pinkie Pie after listening to Twilight's mess up the progress made with Twilights?</p>

			<p>I do have a theory about the effects of ADHD and hypnotism... The ADHD may distract you and keep you from being truly hypnotized, unlike other bronies. Well, that sounds like a college professor, kinda. O.o   Have a cookie emoji!</p>

			<p>I've tried several hypnosiseseses, but I haven't really gotten through any of them because mid-way I typically get an alert for skype or steam or something, because my friends are douchebags unintentionally. (not really.)</p>

<p>The idea of this intruiges me and yet scares the living crap out of me at the same time.</p>
<p>I kind of want to try it, but considering my last bout with a stage hypnotist had me rocking back, visible terrified, watching my GF get hypnotized I'm not sure..</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>From someone who has successfully done this, can you actually think straight while this is happening? can you break out of it any time?</p>

			<p>Funny, the first time i tried Pinkie I got all the feelings down except for the mane and the tail, but now it seems like im only getting the hooves on my 4th try. I should probably try listening to something relaxing before i start again.</p>

</div></blockquote> Well, from my experience with these files, yes you can think straight, if you need to for any reason back out of it at the last minute. Maybe I just wasn't deep enough in the 'trance' to actually be hypnotized, but still. Eeyup.

<p>I tried it 2 1/2 times just now (the half is because I got a horrible itch in my left ear so I had to stop) and so far, good progress.</p>
<p>Does being a boy affect the transformation at all?</p>
<p>Bleh, anyhow.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(255,140,0);">The first time I did it, I was super nervous throughout the whole video so I couldnt get everything down. My left foot was the most realistic part of the pony transformation though, but that's almost about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(255,140,0);">My right foot followed suit a little but I could feel it wasnt complete, and my hands didnt do anything at all. I didnt really feel a tail or wings, and my face/body&#160;didnt exactly change.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(255,140,0);">So that's about it for the first one.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="color:rgb(75,0,130);">The second time I did it, I was a lot more relaxed since I partially knew what would happen. And this time both&#160;my legs changed,&#160;my left arm did pretty well, but my right didnt really comply well.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(75,0,130);">I could start to&#160;feel it change but then my arm twitched so it kinda stopped midway.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(75,0,130);">BUT ANYHOW, the tail I felt a lot, but not so much the wings. For some reason, they were hard to feel on the body but eventually I got them down.&#160;I felt the body change a good bit, and my ears/mane/snout thing changed fairly well.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(128,128,128);">Now the second half time I did it, it was quite common to hear what might happen next, though I wasnt as relaxed because I kept moving a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(128,128,128);">My legs did change but it took it a while. My arms actually did well this time, though my right one kinda stopped half and half.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(128,128,128);">Then that's where it stops from the stupid itch.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Also I must remind you I had a hard time trying not to twitch any part of my body because my mind doesnt take kindly to being controlled.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">2&#160;QUESTIONS:</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">1.&#160;Is there any way to prevent twitching in any&#160;way?</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">2. &#160;What do you do after you 'wake up'? Do you actually open your eyes and&#160;literally&#160;wake up or...</span></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I twitch as well. It may be the position you're in.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>As far as the wake up. It is a 5-count guided wake up. After each number, you will feel more awake. By the count of 5, you're fully up and alert, no longer in trance.&#160;</p>

<p>Just tried applejack twice tonight.  The first time I was shaking 75% of the time and was distracted easily. I had to remind my self to pay attention and be still. I really didn't feel any of the changed. However my legs and fingers tingled when he explained the phrase.  The second time I stopped shacking (probebly because I knew what was gonna happen) my fingers started to feel numb when the changes were explained but that was it.  my elbows started to bend in bringing my hands closet to my body.  Also I felt like I concentrated more the second run.  The first time I couldn't get over how he sounded exactly like my schools principal! I do have a question. How should I sit/lay.  I layed on my bed with out any blankets on me and my head on the pillow, is this ok? Well I'm gonna sleep try again tomorrow.</p>
