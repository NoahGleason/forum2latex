\par{Sooo, there's never a day where I don't see any posts relating to "well I wish I lived in Equestria" or "well I wish I was a pony" so here you guys go, you equestrian race dreamers, here's the next best thing!}
\newline{}
\par{\href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/135UFEsaCEgWuQ3w0-KMb\_f8BEFac26bPrJx2HCpeTrA/edit\#heading=h.w6c82t8k31ic}{https://docs.google.com/document/d/135UFEsaCEgWuQ3w0-KMb\_f8BEFac26bPrJx2HCpeTrA/edit\#heading=h.w6c82t8k31ic}}

\par{Yeah I tried the Pinkie Pie one last night, and it worked fairly well except for whatever reason I broke out if it midway and for the next hour or two I noticed myself acting more crazy and social than usual. If you're gonna try 'em, I'd recommend using the ind+BGM downloads just because that will help out with the hypnotic trance but that's up to you.}
\newline{}
\newline{}
\par{So, if you're gonna come in here and be all like "I don't believe in hypnosis because yadda yadda yadda" be quiet because hypnosis is real aaaand is actually 100\% safe. I studied hypnosis a year or two ago, and even though I kind of can hypnotize somebody, these people do it waaay better than I can at the moment (I always screw up in the trance part and somehow make them laugh)}
\newline{}
\par{Anyhoo, have fun with these things. The people who made these did a nice job.}
\newline{}
\par{-edit-}
\newline{}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{40,40,40}{In response to all the people with issues, I don't think that it's because you aren't susceptible to hypnosis because in reality everyone is, rather I'd say that there's a number of factors involved. Probably the biggest factor is that there's just different ways of getting people into that specific trance and that this method might not work the first time for everyone. I've talked with hypnotists before and they all say that everyone is susceptible to hypnosis, regardless of disability or age (although getting a little kid to concentrate on this will be so damned hard holy crap)}
}\newline{}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{40,40,40}{What I would suggest for this is to keep on trying. Before you do try again, use your own method of relaxation because I know we all have it. If this means laying down in the dark listening to some meditation music than do it. You're also going to need to concentrate not on becoming a pony, rather concentrating on the voice.}
}\newline{}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{40,40,40}{The main issue I'm seeing with those that it didn't work is that they were excited to try this, and I'm not trying to be mean here but I think that excitement about becoming the pony is causing issues. Once again, relax and just find your own method to clear your mind.}
}\newline{}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{40,40,40}{-edit \#2-}
}\newline{}
\par{Alright, alright, alright, alright. The posts that are  put throughout the thread kind of lead me to believe that the way these people do this isn't working for everyone (and I will admit, it's a little bit different than what I usually hear). Before maybe next week starts I will have some alternate files with my own induction techniques that I'm hoping will be of greater assistance.}
\newline{}
\par{This will be the first time in about a year I've tried to induce somebody into a trance, so it might take a bit. I'll update the first post once I get something done.}

\par{edit\#5I swear to god next person who brings up tulpae in this thread... uuughh... Lemme just say it right now to make it clear: TULPAE AND HYPNOSIS ARE TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THINGS! Hypnosis is just getting into a state where you're more open to suggestion where as tulpae are actually altering your mind in an attempt to have a separate personality in there that you can see and touch. Also while we're at it since some people who are ZOMG TULPAE have contacted me and said that hypnosis is crap: there's much more actual evidence for hypnosis than there are for tulpae.\newline{}
\newline{}
Also the downloads for the files are currently gone for a little. Derp.}

\par{You're probably thinking too hard. Just take a deep breath, and relax. Listen to some relaxing music for a few minutes and try again. To be hypnotized, you have to essentially be in a trance which is generally achieved through relaxation}

\par{I would so try this, to hypnotize myself to be Rainbow Dash. Even though the transformation would be painful, I'm still up for it.}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=DeleteAccount]
\par{so i got to 18 minutes in rarity's thing then my brother thought i was sleeping, even though i told him clearly not to disturb me, and he then shined a light in my face. so i listened to the deprogram thing and ill listen to rarity again later probably}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Antismurf9001]
\par{I'm not going to lie, this sounds absolutely terrifying.  Messing with my mind and willingly turning myself into someone else doesn't really sit well with me...  I might try it, but I'd make sure to be alone, and have nothing to do for a good long while.}

\par{It's not painful. It's relaxing, I tried it and it actually worked for a few minutes or so but I snapped myself out of it somehow. I'm not sure how. I tried the Fluttershy one.}
\newline{}
\newline{}
\par{It washed over a numbness over me, and I lost feeling in my fingers. I eventually felt the urge to be kind to be people for some reason. It was really weird and surreal. I could feel my heart beating too, rapidly, and also, the coolest thing was that it felt good, actually.}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=SCS]
\par{This is very interesting. How powerful is this? Like, if you did the hypnosis for Rarity, would you feel like you had a horn that you could do magic with (all in your imagination)? Or, if you did the hypnosis for Fluttershy, would you feel like you had wings? Could you feel like you were flying?}

\par{So I just tried the Pinkie Pie one. Nothing. I'll try again later, but since I just spent 17 minutes laying in my bed doing nothing, I'm not sure if I want to do it again today. I'm mostly afraid of my parents or brother coming in and disturbing me. I \textit{really} want to be a pony.}

\par{Use hypnosis to become a pony? This sounds like a sick and wrong corruption of the mental arts.}

\par{So BUCK YEAH, I'm going to do it!}

\par{...Just as soon as somepony else goes first, tries them all, and checks if they work or not. My mind doesn't work the same as other people's, (The old red-and-blue 3d paper glasses don't work on me.)}

\par{i was addicted to studying hypnosis and even kept up on it for a year. but then i got bored and it's taken me at least..... what? let's see... i started the idea for it in.... 5th grade......ok, so, it took me (and is still taking), me at least 3 years to just get the basic IDEA for a good book. it you want to read what i have so far, see here --> \href{http://www.wattpad.com/11434520-tears-of-blood-1}{http://www.wattpad.com/11434520-tears-of-blood-1}}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Admiral Colt]

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=MatrixChicken]
\par{Huh. xD I got around 3/4 of the way through the Twilight one. I can't believe I even tried it, as I'm sure it can be dangerous. Demons can enter you this way, I'm sure. It didn't really affect me, though... I did get tired, and I tried to imagine all of the "changes" he was talking about, but nothing really happened. I'm going to stay away form things like this from now on, for as some have said, it gets you intrigued, and maybe even addicted, and bad things could happen.  \includegraphics{images/mlp_PR6Zd18.png}}
\newline{}
\par{I'm a Christian, BTW, so this is more of a moral issue for me rather than that I don't want to do it. Being relaxed and "emptying your mind" is the perfect opportunity for demons to sneak in, so Imma stay away from it. :unsure:}

\par{Hypnotic effects wear off the moment you want them to wear off. I've dabbled in hypnosis for a while and the only thing I've really succeded in doing is curing my panic attacks (which that on its own has made it worth while). The way I define hypnosis is anything that takes advantage of brain quirks. For example, have you ever gotten up to go to a differant room and when you get to that room you suddenly forget why you went there? Its a funky little brain quirk, and believe it or not, its times like that when you are easily subjected to hypnotic suggestion.}

\par{To clear things up for people, Hypnosis is 100\% safe. It just puts your brain in a hyper-suggestive state (starting to get close to a dream), but you aren't a zombie slave or anything. You can break out of it at any time. You are always in control. Trust me, I've studied the subject a lot and I know the basics.}
\newline{}
\par{Note that everyone is different and it might take some people longer, and vice versa. No-one is insusceptible to Hypnosis, but for some people it may take a few tries. Note that you have to go in without any resistance and willingness to follow orders as well, which may be a problem for some people. Also, extroverted people tend to have an easier time with Hypnosis, while introverted people aren't as likely.}

Its not harmful, and it won't harm you in any way whatsoever. I suggest to everypony to lay down in your bed, head on the pillow, and a blanket covering your eyes.

I was astonishingly relaxed and it felt numb and I felt extremely relaxed. I could feel my hoof and I am definitely much more confident right now as I write this. It was like someone was massaging my hand, going in a soft, circular motion, definitely one of the best things I ever felt. Then came the counting up, when one was supposed to wake up. Well, I admit I got pretty tired as the hypnosis was happening, and as she counted up, I actually got more and more awake. This definitely has my approval and I will use it again sometime, probably for RD, Twilight or Fluttershy.}

\par{Part of it is the setting itself; as a number of ponies have mentioned, you have to be very relaxed, and maybe in a fairly dark and relaxing setting.  Another part is the individual; some are more susceptible to hypnotism than others.  I've tried a couple of hypnotism vids in the past myself (not MLP related) and, while they sort of worked, sometimes I was in the wrong place, and other times I just couldn't get relaxed enough.  I also had the feeling that I'd have to listen to said vids on a regular basis for the full effect, so I eventually just kinda gave up on it.  Don't think I'll try these vids, even though I'm sure they're perfectly safe and sound very cool, mostly because there's no good place in my college dorm to listen to it.  My bed's simply not comfortable enough, and being a bunk, I'd constantly be distracted by the thought of and worrying about falling out!  \includegraphics{images/mlp_laugh.png}   Still, good luck to anypony who tries these out, they sound pretty cool!!!  \includegraphics{images/mlp_8pfRZzv.png}}

\par{When you say takes a few tries, do you mean one after the other with the same pony? Or try again day after day?}
\par{Because i've sat and tried the RD one 3 times now, and I got nothing more than numb hooves and itchy wings.  }

\par{Either one will work. Probably day after day but it mostly depends on who is doing it. I didn't do one with wings so I couldn't tell you about that part.}

\par{Interesting.  I stumbled upon this thread yesterday and I finally got around to doing it today.   I got about 1/2 through the Twilight one before getting interuptted.  I felt relaxed, but that's about it.  Then, I decided to give Fluttershy a shot.  I was just going through these for curiosities sake.  I must say, it was an odd feeling.  I got about 1/2 way through Fluttershy too though.  However, the effects were much more immediate.  Although I didn't feel the hooves and whatnot, I did begin to feel them form.  It doesn't really work in the way the voice describes it.  It's almost like your limbs are slowly being replaced by them rather than your limbs forming into them.  I'll probably commit fully when I go to bed.  Even though I'm home alone ATM, phone calls keep interuptting.  Hopefully it will work fully tonight.}

\par{Well, what I read at the front page was odd...}
\par{But anyhow besides that, one thing that might prevent me from hypnotizing myself is my constantly working mind. And the only time I can clear that stupid thing is on sunday mornings when I go bowling.}
\par{This isnt a joke but 90\% of my mind is music that constantly plays songs all day long. Once it stops though then I cant have anyone talking to me for a bit since anything anyone says (mostly the word 'trance') will make me think of music, any time. If im doing something, I think of music but unless im listening to music, then I think of my orikeros.}

\par{but its worth a shot. Ill try it in the morning after I finish school.}

\par{My mind is a perpetual loop of "I AM.....THE LAW!" but it didn't stop me. But in all seriousness, there is a track on the page that is meant to help you clear your head.

\par{In response to all the people with issues, I don't think that it's because you aren't susceptible to hypnosis because in reality everyone is, rather I'd say that there's a number of factors involved. Probably the biggest factor is that there's just different ways of getting people into that specific trance and that this method might not work the first time for everyone. I've talked with hypnotists before and they all say that everyone is susceptible to hypnosis, regardless of disability or age (although getting a little kid to concentrate on this will be so damned hard holy crap)}
\newline{}
\par{What I would suggest for this is to keep on trying. Before you do try again, use your own method of relaxation because I know we all have it. If this means laying down in the dark listening to some meditation music than do it. You're also going to need to concentrate not on becoming a pony, rather concentrating on the voice.}
\newline{}
\par{The main issue I'm seeing with those that it didn't work is that they were excited to try this, and I'm not trying to be mean here but I think that excitement about becoming the pony is causing issues. Once again, relax and just find your own method to clear your mind.}

\par{3rd try for the Pinkie Pie file. I felt mostly the same as last time. Barely felt the transformation, as if it didn't happen. But I \textit{did} feel more relaxed than last time. But you know what's strange? Afterwards, I tried walking like a pony, to see if it worked. Nothing. Then I spoke the phrase. All of a sudden, I felt dizzy. I started to feel the face and ear transformations, and my mouth opened. After feeling that, my body started to move onto all fours. Right after that, however, the feelings stopped. Will definitely try again soon.}

\par{You have to actually listen to the voice and nothing else, and make sure you relax as much as you possibly can. After that let your mind go blank, literally don't think of anything at all and keep listening to the voice, this should be around the time that it starts telling you who you're going to be hypnotized into thinking you are If you do that you should be able to feel it but it can take a few tries to get the relaxation part right (getting your mind to go blank is probably the hardest part, at least it is for me).}

\par{I've been interested in hypnotism for a while now and I know a little bit about it (ever since my psych prof in college told me there is actually something to it), so it was a little easier for me. All I can say is, you have to 'give in,' yes its a placebo, but guess what, the placebo effect actually has tangible results (learned that in psych class too). Give in... just let the voice take control, and you will begin to experience the things that he's suggesting.}
\newline{}
\par{And yes, this is 100\% safe, you only give him control for as long as you want him to be in control. In fact about about 3/4s of the way through the video I was like 'lol, ok yeah you know what you're doing, I'm me again.' And I was me again. Simple as that. The only reason why I didn't zap back to being me again earlier than that is because I DIDN'T WANT TO. I WANTED to be Twilight Sparkle for a while and yeah I got pretty close. I felt the horn, I felt the hooves, almost felt the mane. And I knew what was happening too, I knew at any moment I could stop it if I wanted to, but I didn't, cause it was fun. \includegraphics{images/mlp_smile.png}}

\par{Tried the Vinyl Scratch hypnosis last night while lying in bed. It was...wow. I felt my fingers fade away (my feet were somewhere in between, kinda like anthro-ish hooves...if that explains it). The horn didn't really form, but I remember being overcome by a strong sense of euphoria when the story of how you get your cutie mark is explained. I even remember tasting rum a little when the narrator explains how you took your first shot of Pony Morgan. }

\par{I started to fall asleep as the narrator explained ear and muzzle changes. I didn't feel them, but I did feel a sense of comfort and peace. Then I fell asleep, and I had euphoric dreams (I didn't remember them, but I had the lingering feeling when I woke up).}

I went numb and got all tingly and thought I started feeling the hooves but that's about it before it failed on me. I did feel more relaxed than i've every been in the process. I'll have to try it again later on today and see if I can get the Twilight one to work again. I have alot on my mind so i'm kinda surprised that I even got it to work in the first place. XD}

\par{And for those who want to know:}

\par{Man, this sucks for the bronies out there with ADHD. Darn ADHD always bugging you and making it IMPOSSIBLE to focus, or sit still for that matter. Remind anypony of Pinkie Pie? Anyway I tried this a second time after being interrupted with the Rarity one (dumb siblings!) and I actually did feel my hands go kinda numb a bit but I could still move them and stuff so It didn't work well for me but I have a REALLY hard time clearing my mind.  Kinda awesome, even if my try was a flop.  My sis got hypnotized and she couldn't stand up at all until she said the special phrase. At least it worked for her. \includegraphics{images/mlp_smile.png} I'm honestly not sad about that, though, if I'm making it seem that way...}

\par{Does it work after you snap out of it? Or does it only work right after the voice finished?}
\par{I tried listening to it full yesterday, didn't help even after speaking the phrase. I guess I was too awake. Do I have to be conscious? Or do I need to be nearly asleep?}

\par{Report \#6. I didn't feel as much changes this time, but I felt more of a need to stand on all fours afterwards. It was probably because I was laying in a terrible position.}
\newline{}
\par{EDIT: Now that I'm at a PC, I can write more. When I say the phrase, I feel pretty mush nothing. It seems that for a while after I'm done listening to the file I feel the need to walk on all fours after saying the phrase, but that's it. I'm the same guy. I can still use my fingers, and I still constantly feel the need to listen to Voltage (or whatever my favorite song is at the moment). On top of that, my patience was pretty thin from the events of earlier today. I managed to calm down, but I almost didn't have the patience to listen to the whole 17 minute file. At least I made it through the whole thing. I twitched a lot, but that was probably because of how I was laying.}

\newline{}
\par{Even after I finished it, the phrase to snap me in and out was "I'm an awesome pony" and "Revert to normal".

\par{lol before I say this I would like to say I'm going to try this later today. Ohkay quiet and peaceful music, huh? My relaxing music is hardcore dubstep and electronic music. And improvisions that will affect the trance?}
\end{tcolorbox}
\par{Well, if you find the sound of rain to be peaceful, then I can suggest you to this site while you do it \href{http://www.rainymood.com/}{http://www.rainymood.com/} It's a constant sound of rain, I haven't tried it, but I know what it sounds like.}

\par{7th try! I think. Oh well! I felt not very many changes in my body, but I felt the face more! I also have some personality from this, too! That's why I don't type the same in this report. I hope it doesn't wear off! I wish I felt the body changes more, though.}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=C. Thunder Dash,colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black,coltitle=white]
\par{I felt the hooves, but that's all I feel. I have felt the wings before, but not the tail. Is there something I'm doing wrong? (Or screw ADHD). }

\par{I'm using Google Chrome by the way.}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Shining Wing,colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,coltitle=white]
\par{Everything seems to be right. Just keep trying.}

\par{Chrome does that. It does that on the desktop version, too, but right-clicking lets you download the file. Try a different browser.}

\par{Alright, so I just got time to try this for the first time.  As I expected, it didn't quite work, though to no fault of the track itself.  It's my own mind just being the way it is.}
\newline{}
\par{I did Pinkie Pie (because why not?).  I think I was doing well until the guide said, "let everything unimportant leave your mind."  Of course, my mind immediately went to 'everything important' which happened to be my Theory of Computation homework.  I was pretty much lost after that.  As for the transformations, I could sort of feel the rear end one, but not much.  I also noticed that for a few minutes afterwards, the backs of my hands felt slightly harder than usual, but that has long since gone away, and likely doesn't mean anything either.  It also doesn't help that immediately after the end of the track my music library switched to}

 (which I found absolutely hilarious and was laughing like an idiot, though that's my kind of humor, so I don't think it had to do with the hypnosis).\newline{}
\par{In conclusion, I'm sure that this works, however my mind is not trained to it yet.  I would like to try to train my self to do so because I would love the relaxation benefits.  This will not be the last time I attempt this.  I may even have time for one more tonight.}
\newline{}
\par{A question: I noticed that there's loop files and non-loop files.  Should I be looping these and listening multiple times, or just once?  Does that just depend on the person?}

\par{Attempted the Twilight Sparkle one and it made me soooo relaxed!}
\par{I only got a few little sensations such as a horn and my face changing, but hopefully if I keep trying it it will work more and more! \carat{}\carat{}}
\newline{}
\par{Is there anything against trying different ones in the same day or something? Like, would switching to say, Pinkie Pie after listening to Twilight's mess up the progress made with Twilights?}

\par{I do have a theory about the effects of ADHD and hypnotism... The ADHD may distract you and keep you from being truly hypnotized, unlike other bronies. Well, that sounds like a college professor, kinda. O.o   Have a cookie emoji!}

\par{I've tried several hypnosiseseses, but I haven't really gotten through any of them because mid-way I typically get an alert for skype or steam or something, because my friends are douchebags unintentionally. (not really.)}

\par{The idea of this intruiges me and yet scares the living crap out of me at the same time.}
\par{I kind of want to try it, but considering my last bout with a stage hypnotist had me rocking back, visible terrified, watching my GF get hypnotized I'm not sure..}

\par{From someone who has successfully done this, can you actually think straight while this is happening? can you break out of it any time?}

\par{Funny, the first time i tried Pinkie I got all the feelings down except for the mane and the tail, but now it seems like im only getting the hooves on my 4th try. I should probably try listening to something relaxing before i start again.}

Well, from my experience with these files, yes you can think straight, if you need to for any reason back out of it at the last minute. Maybe I just wasn't deep enough in the 'trance' to actually be hypnotized, but still. Eeyup.\end{tcolorbox}

\par{I tried it 2 1/2 times just now (the half is because I got a horrible itch in my left ear so I had to stop) and so far, good progress.}
\par{Does being a boy affect the transformation at all?}
\par{Bleh, anyhow.}
\newline{}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{255,140,0}{The first time I did it, I was super nervous throughout the whole video so I couldnt get everything down. My left foot was the most realistic part of the pony transformation though, but that's almost about it.}}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{255,140,0}{My right foot followed suit a little but I could feel it wasnt complete, and my hands didnt do anything at all. I didnt really feel a tail or wings, and my face/body didnt exactly change.}}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{255,140,0}{So that's about it for the first one.}}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{75,0,130}{The second time I did it, I was a lot more relaxed since I partially knew what would happen. And this time both my legs changed, my left arm did pretty well, but my right didnt really comply well.}}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{75,0,130}{I could start to feel it change but then my arm twitched so it kinda stopped midway.}}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{75,0,130}{BUT ANYHOW, the tail I felt a lot, but not so much the wings. For some reason, they were hard to feel on the body but eventually I got them down. I felt the body change a good bit, and my ears/mane/snout thing changed fairly well.}}
\newline{}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{128,128,128}{Now the second half time I did it, it was quite common to hear what might happen next, though I wasnt as relaxed because I kept moving a little.}}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{128,128,128}{My legs did change but it took it a while. My arms actually did well this time, though my right one kinda stopped half and half.}}
\par{\textcolor[RGB]{128,128,128}{Then that's where it stops from the stupid itch.}}
\newline{}
\par{Also I must remind you I had a hard time trying not to twitch any part of my body because my mind doesnt take kindly to being controlled.}

\par{\textcolor[RGB]{255,0,0}{2 QUESTIONS:}}

\par{\textcolor[RGB]{255,0,0}{1. Is there any way to prevent twitching in any way?}}

\end{tcolorbox}
\par{I twitch as well. It may be the position you're in.}
\newline{}
\par{As far as the wake up. It is a 5-count guided wake up. After each number, you will feel more awake. By the count of 5, you're fully up and alert, no longer in trance. }

\par{Just tried applejack twice tonight.  The first time I was shaking 75\% of the time and was distracted easily. I had to remind my self to pay attention and be still. I really didn't feel any of the changed. However my legs and fingers tingled when he explained the phrase.  The second time I stopped shacking (probebly because I knew what was gonna happen) my fingers started to feel numb when the changes were explained but that was it.  my elbows started to bend in bringing my hands closet to my body.  Also I felt like I concentrated more the second run.  The first time I couldn't get over how he sounded exactly like my schools principal! I do have a question. How should I sit/lay.  I layed on my bed with out any blankets on me and my head on the pillow, is this ok? Well I'm gonna sleep try again tomorrow.}
