If you're gonna try 'em, I'd\u00a0recommend\u00a0using the ind+BGM downloads just because that will help out with the hypnotic trance but that's up to you.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo, if you're gonna come in here and be all like \"I don't believe in hypnosis because yadda yadda yadda\" be quiet because hypnosis is real aaaand is actually 100% safe. I studied hypnosis a year or two ago, and even though I kind of can hypnotize somebody, these people do it waaay better than I can at the moment (I always screw up in the trance part and somehow make them laugh)\n\u00a0\nAnyhoo, have fun with these things. The people who made these did a nice job.\n\u00a0\n-edit-\n\u00a0\nIn response to all the people with issues, I don't think that it's because you aren't susceptible to hypnosis because in reality everyone is, rather I'd say that there's a number of factors involved. Probably the biggest factor is that there's just different ways of getting people into that specific trance and that this method might not work the first time for everyone. I've talked with hypnotists before and they all say that everyone is susceptible to hypnosis, regardless of disability or age (although getting a little kid to concentrate on this will be so damned hard holy crap)\n\u00a0\nWhat I would suggest for this is to keep on trying. Before you do try again, use your own method of relaxation because I know we all have it. If this means laying down in the dark listening to some meditation music than do it. You're also going to need to concentrate not on becoming a pony, rather concentrating on the voice.\n\u00a0\nThe main issue I'm seeing with those that it didn't work is that they were excited to try this, and I'm not trying to be mean here but I think that excitement about becoming the pony is causing issues. Once again, relax and just find your own method to clear your mind.\n\u00a0\n-edit #2-\n\u00a0\nAlright, alright, alright, alright. The posts that are \u00a0put throughout the thread kind of lead me to believe that the way these people do this isn't working for everyone (and I will admit, it's a little bit different than what I usually hear). Before maybe next week starts I will have some alternate files with my own induction techniques that I'm hoping will be of greater assistance.\n\u00a0\nThis will be the first time in about a year I've tried to induce somebody into a trance, so it might take a bit. I'll update the first post once I get something done.\n\u00a0\nedit #3\nlol after many months I still haven't delivered\n\u00a0\nedit #4\nFINLAND\n\u00a0\nedit#5I swear to god next person who brings up tulpae in this thread... uuughh... Lemme just say it right now to make it clear: TULPAE AND HYPNOSIS ARE TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THINGS! Hypnosis is just getting into a state where you're more open to suggestion where as tulpae are actually altering your mind in an attempt to have a separate personality in there that you can see and touch. Also while we're at it since some people who are ZOMG TULPAE have contacted me and said that hypnosis is crap: there's much more actual evidence for hypnosis than there are for tulpae.Also the downloads for the files are currently gone for a little.

Probably the biggest factor is that there's just different ways of getting people into that specific trance and that this method might not work the first time for everyone. I've talked with hypnotists before and they all say that everyone is susceptible to hypnosis, regardless of disability or age (although getting a little kid to concentrate on this will be so damned hard holy crap)\n\u00a0\nWhat I would suggest for this is to keep on trying. Before you do try again, use your own method of relaxation because I know we all have it. If this means laying down in the dark listening to some meditation music than do it. You're also going to need to concentrate not on becoming a pony, rather concentrating on the voice.\n\u00a0\nThe main issue I'm seeing with those that it didn't work is that they were excited to try this, and I'm not trying to be mean here but I think that excitement about becoming the pony is causing issues.

I just tried Twilight for the first time and felt pretty much everything. Half way through I was giggling 'I has a horn' lol.\n\u00a0\nI've been interested in hypnotism for a while now and I know a little bit about it (ever since my psych prof in college told me there is actually something to it), so it was a little easier for me. All I can say is, you have to 'give in,' yes its a placebo, but guess what, the placebo effect actually has tangible results (learned that in psych class too). Give in... just let the voice take control, and you will begin to experience the things that he's suggesting.\n\u00a0\nAnd yes, this is 100% safe, you only give him control for as long as you want him to be in control. In fact about about 3/4s of the way through the video I was like 'lol, ok yeah you know what you're doing, I'm me again.' And I was me again. Simple as that. The only reason why I didn't zap back to being me again earlier than that is because I DIDN'T WANT TO. I WANTED to be Twilight Sparkle for a while and yeah I got pretty close. I felt the horn, I felt the hooves, almost felt the mane. And I knew what was happening too, I knew at any moment I could stop it if I wanted to, but I didn't, cause it was fun. \n\u00a0\nBTW, look up my post in the life advice forum on how to cure panic attacks if you suffer from panic attacks... that's hypnotism too. \n", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://mlpforums.com/topic/47085-hypnotize-yourself-to-be-a-pony-links-included/"},
